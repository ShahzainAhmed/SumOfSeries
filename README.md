# Sum of Series = 1 + x^2/2 + x^3/3 + … x^n/n

## Problem Description: 
### The program takes in the the number of terms and finds the sum of series: 
### 1 + x^2/2 + x^3/3 + … x^n/n.

## Problem Solution:
- Take in the number of terms to find the sum of the series for.
- Initialize the sum variable to 0.
- Use a for loop ranging from 1 to the number and find the sum of the series.
- Print the sum of the series after rounding it off to two decimal places.
- Exit.

## Program Explanation:
- User must enter the number of terms to find the sum of.
- The sum variable is initialized to 0.
- The for loop is used to find the sum of the series and the number is incremented for each iteration.
- The numbers are added to the sum variable and this continues till the value of i reaches the number of terms.
